I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Discord](https://discord.com), where I try to build ML systems that protect our users and keep the platform safe.

[Prior to this](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelczerny/#:~:text=Show%20all%20posts-,Experience,-Experience), I worked on applying ML to cybersecurity problems for about 8 years.

In a previous life, I was a Master's student in Physics at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) studying the early universe. In particular, my focus was on [inflation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation). You can view my list of publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6f1MzgAAAAJ&hl=en).
